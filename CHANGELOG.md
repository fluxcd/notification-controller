# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 1.5.0

**Release date:** 2025-02-13

This minor release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.

### Alert

Now notification-controller also sends event metadata specified in Flux objects through
annotations. See [docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/alerts/#event-metadata-from-object-annotations).

Now notification-controller is also capable of updating Git commit statuses
from events about Kustomizations that consume OCIRepositories. See
[docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/oci-artifacts/#git-commit-status-updates).

### Receiver

The Receiver API now supports filtering the declared resources that
match a given Common Expression Language (CEL) expression. See
[docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/receivers/#filtering-reconciled-objects-with-cel).

In addition, the Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.32.1 and
various other controller dependencies have been updated to their latest
version.

## 1.4.0

**Release date:** 2024-09-27

This minor release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.

MS Teams Provider has been updated to support MS Adaptive Card payloads.
This allows users to migrate from the deprecated
[Office 365 Connector for Incoming Webhooks](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/)
to the new [Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhooks with Workflows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-incoming-webhooks-with-workflows-for-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498).
See the [Provider API documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/providers/#microsoft-teams)
for more information. After getting the URL for the new Incoming Webhook Workflow,
update the secret used by the `msteams` Provider object with the new URL.

In addition, the Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.31.1 and
various other controller dependencies have been updated to their latest
version. The controller is now built with Go 1.23.

## 1.3.0

**Release date:** 2024-05-06

This minor release comes with new features, improvements and bug fixes.

The `Receiver` API has been extended to support CDEvents,
for more information, please see the
[CDEvents Receiver API documentation](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/release/v1.3.x/docs/spec/v1/receivers.md#cdevents).

Starting with this version, the controller allows grouping alerts for Alertmanager
by setting the `startsAt` label instead of `timestamp`. When sending alerts to
OpsGenie, the controller now sets the `severity` field to the alert's details.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated to Kubernetes v1.30
and controller-runtime v0.18. Various other dependencies have also been updated to
their latest version to patch upstream CVEs.

Lastly, the controller is now built with Go 1.22.

Improvements:
- Add CDEvent Receiver Support
  [#772](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/772)
- Add severity to opsgenie alerts
  [#796](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/796)

backwards compatibility issue when `.spec.interval` was explicitly set in a
v1beta2 version of Provider.

Fixes:
- Exclude eventv1.MetaTokenKey from event metadata
  [#686](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/686)
- Add .spec.interval in v1beta3 Provider
  [#683](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/683)

  [#682](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/682)

## 1.2.2

**Release date:** 2023-12-11

This patch releases updates a variety of dependencies, including an update of
the container base image to Alpine v3.19.

Improvements:
- build: update Alpine to 3.19
  [#675](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/675)
- Update dependencies
  [#677](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/677)

## 1.2.1

**Release date:** 2023-12-08

This patch release updates the Go version the controller is built with to
`1.21.x`, while mitigating recently published security vulnerabilities in the
`net/http` package.

In addition, it ensures static analyzers no longer detect a vulnerability in the
`whilp/git-urls` module by using `chainguard-dev/git-urls`. For which the
(potential) issue itself got already addressed internally in the [previous
v1.2.0 release](#120).

Lastly, a small number of dependencies got updated to their latest versions.

Improvements:
- Update Go to 1.21.x
  [#666](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/666)
- Replace whilp/git-urls module by chainguard-dev/git-urls
  [#667](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/667)
- Update dependencies
  [#669](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/669)

## 1.2.0

**Release date:** 2023-12-05

This minor release graduates the notification `Alert` and `Provider` APIs to
`v1beta3`. In addition, this version comes with alert Provider support for
[BitBucket
Server](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/api/v1.2.0/docs/spec/v1beta3/providers.md#bitbucket-serverdata-center)
and
[NATS](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/api/v1.2.0/docs/spec/v1beta3/providers.md#nats).

### `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta3`

After upgrading the controller to v1.2.0, please update the notification Custom
Resources for `Alert` and `Provider` in Git by replacing
`notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2` with
`notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta3` in all the YAML manifests.

#### Static Alerts and Providers

The notification Alert and Provider API resources will become static objects
with configurations that will be used by the event handlers for processing the
respective incoming events. They will no longer be reconciled by a reconciler
and will not advertise any status. Once `Alerts` and `Providers` are created,
they can be considered ready. Users of
[kstatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md)
shouldn't see any difference. Existing `Alerts` and `Providers` objects in
`v1beta2` API will undergo a one-time automatic migration to be converted into
static objects without any status.

#### Enhanced Alert events

The event handler will emit Kubernetes native events on the respective Alert
object for any relevant information, including failures due to any
misconfiguration.

Improvements:
- Add Provider for NATS Subject
  [#651](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/651)
- Cap provider address at 2048 bytes
  [#654](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/654)

## 1.1.0

**Release date:** 2023-08-23

This minor release comes with support for sending alerts
to [PagerDuty](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/v1.1.0/docs/spec/v1beta2/providers.md#datadog).

In addition, this version deprecates the usage of the `caFile` key in favor of `ca.crt`
for the `.spec.certSecretRef` secret in the Provider v1beta2 API.

Starting with this version, the controller now stops exporting an object's
metrics as soon as the object has been deleted.

Improvements:

- Add support for Datadog

  [#585](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/585)

## 1.0.0

**Release date:** 2023-07-04

This is the first stable release of the controller. From now on, this controller
follows the [Flux 2 release cadence and support pledge](https://fluxcd.io/flux/releases/).

Starting with this version, the build, release and provenance portions of the
Flux project supply chain [provisionally meet SLSA Build Level 3](https://fluxcd.io/flux/security/slsa-assessment/).

This release comes with support for sending alerts
to [PagerDuty](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/v1.0.0/docs/spec/v1beta2/providers.md#pagerduty)
and [Google Pub/Sub](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/v1.0.0/docs/spec/v1beta2/providers.md#google-pubsub).

In addition, dependencies have been updated
to their latest version, including an update of Kubernetes to v1.27.3.

## 1.0.0-rc.4

**Release date:** 2023-05-26

This release candidate comes with support for Kubernetes v1.27.

The `Event` API has been modified to have a dedicated key for `metadata` called
`token`. The value of the `token` key is meant to be defined on a per event
emitter basis for uniquely identifying the contents of the event payload.
This key if present, is included in calculating the unique key used for rate
limiting events.
Furthermore, the event attributes are prefixed with an identifier to avoid
collisions between different event attributes.

In addition, a bug in the event rate limiting key calculation logic which led
to the inconsideration of the revision specified in `.metadata` of the event has
been fixed.

Lastly, the behavior of `.spec.eventMetadata` has been modified such that if a
key present in the map already exists in the original event's `metadata`, then
the key in the latter takes precedence and an error log is printed for visibility.

Improvements:

- Include eventv1.MetaTokenKey on event rate limiting key calculation
  [#530](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/530)
- Update dependencies and Kubernetes to 1.27.2
  [#532](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/532)
- Remove the tini supervisor
  [#533](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/533)
- Prefix event key attributes with identifier
  [#534](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/534)
- Update workflows and enable dependabot
  [#535](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/535)
- build(deps): bump github/codeql-action from 2.3.3 to 2.3.4
  [#536](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/536)

Fixes:

- Fix revision discarded on event rate limiting key calculation
  [#517](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/517)
- Fix Alert .spec.eventMetadata behavior
  [#529](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/529)

## 1.0.0-rc.3

**Release date:** 2023-05-12

This release candidate comes with support for
adding [custom metadata](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/v1.0.0-rc.3/docs/spec/v1beta2/alerts.md#event-metadata)
to Flux events. A new field was added to the Alert v1beta2 API named
`.spec.eventMetadata` that allows users to enrich the alerts with
information about the cluster name, region, environment, etc.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated to patch
CVE-2023-1732 and the base image has been updated to Alpine 3.18.

Improvements:
- Add event metadata field to Alert spec
  [#519](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/506)
- Update Alpine to 3.18
  [#524](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/524)
- build(deps): bump github.com/cloudflare/circl from 1.3.2 to 1.3.3
  [#525](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/525)

## 1.0.0-rc.2

**Release date:** 2023-05-09

This release candidate comes with performance improvements for Receivers
and removes the deprecated `.status.url` field from the Receiver v1 API.

A new field was added to the Alert v1beta2 API named `.spec.inclusionList` for
better control over events filtering.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated to their latest
versions.

Improvements:
- Index receivers using webhook path as key
  [#506](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/506)
- Append the Alert summary to Azure DevOps genre field
  [#514](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/514)
- Add InclusionList to Alert CRD
  [#515](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/515)
- Update dependencies
  [#520](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/520)
- Improve event handler tests
  [#521](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/521)
- receiver/v1: Remove deprecated `.status.url` field
  [#482](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/482)

## 1.0.0-rc.1

**Release date:** 2023-03-30

This release candidate promotes the Receiver API from v1beta2 to v1. The Receiver v1 API now supports triggering the reconciliation of multiple 
resources using match labels.

### Highlights

#### API changes

The `Receiver` kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA). All other kinds of the notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io group stay at version v1beta2.

The receivers.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io CRD contains the following versions:

- v1 (storage version)
- v1beta2 (deprecated)
- v1beta1 (deprecated)

#### Upgrade Procedure

The `Receiver` v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2.

To upgrade from v1beta2, after deploying the new CRD and controller, set `apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that 
contain `Receiver` definitions. Bumping the API version in manifests can be done gradually. It is advised to not delay this procedure as the beta 
versions will be removed after 6 months.

### Full Changelog

Improvements:
- GA: Promote Receiver API to notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
  [#498](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/498)
- support multiple resources in Receivers by using match labels
  [#482](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/482)
- docs: fixes to the Receiver documentation
  [#495](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/495)

default value for `spec.interval`.

Fixes:
* Fix panic when upgrading to v1beta2
  [#455](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/455)

## 0.30.0

**Release date:** 2022-12-20

This prerelease graduates the notification APIs to `v1beta2`.
In addition, this version comes with support for
[Gitea commit status updates](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/api/v0.30.0/docs/spec/v1beta2/providers.md#gitea).

### `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`

After upgrading the controller to v0.30.0, you need to update the notification
**Custom Resources** in Git
by replacing `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1` with
`notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2` in all YAML manifests.

#### Breaking changes

- The `Alert.spec.summary` has a max length of 255 characters.
- The `Provider.spec.address` and `Provider.spec.proxy` have a max length of 2048 characters.
- The `Receiver.status.url` was deprecated in favour of `Receiver.status.webhookPath`.

#### API specifications in a user-friendly format

[The new specifications for the `v1beta2` API](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/tree/v0.30.0/docs/spec/v1beta2)
have been written in a new format with the aim to be more valuable to a user.
Featuring separate sections with examples, and information on how to write
and work with them.

#### Enhanced Kubernetes Conditions

Notification API resources will now advertise more explicit Condition types,
provide `Reconciling` and `Stalled` Conditions where applicable for
[better integration with `kstatus`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md#conditions),
and record the Observed Generation on the Condition.

#### Enhanced Git commit status updates

Starting with this version, the controller uses the `Provider` cluster assigned `UID`
to compose a unique Git commit status ID to avoid name collisions
when multiple clusters write to the same repository.

Improvements:
* Refactor reconcilers and introduce v1beta2 API
  [#435](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/435)
- feat: add gitea notifier

## 0.27.0

**Release date:** 2022-09-27

This prerelease comes with strict validation rules for API fields which define a
(time) duration. Effectively, this means values without a time unit (e.g. `ms`,
`s`, `m`, `h`) will now be rejected by the API server. To stimulate sane
configurations, the units `ns`, `us` and `µs` can no longer be configured, nor
can `h` be set for fields defining a timeout value.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated
to Kubernetes controller-runtime v0.13.

## 0.21.0

**Release date:** 2022-01-28

This prerelease comes with security improvements for multi-tenant clusters.

Platform admins can disable cross-namespace references with the
`--no-cross-namespace-refs=true` flag.
When this flag is set, alerts can only refer to event sources in the same namespace
as the alert object, preventing tenants from subscribing to another tenant's events.

Starting with this version, the controller deployment conforms to the
Kubernetes [restricted pod security standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted):
- all Linux capabilities were dropped
- the root filesystem was set to read-only
- the seccomp profile was set to the runtime default
- run as non-root was enabled
- the user and group ID was set to 65534

**Breaking changes**:
- The use of new seccomp API requires Kubernetes 1.19.
- The controller container is now executed under 65534:65534 (userid:groupid).
  This change may break deployments that hard-coded the user ID of 'controller' in their PodSecurityPolicy.

Features:
* Pass headers to generic provider through secretRef
  [#317](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/317)

Improvements:
* Allow disabling cross-namespace event sources

## 0.19.0

**Release date:** 2021-11-23

This prerelease introduces the `Reconciling` and `Stalled` Condition Types
to indicate if a resource is under reconciliation, or has failed to reach
a `Ready==True` state. This is most beneficial to consumers making use of
[`kstatus`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md),
which uses the information to return early instead of timing out.

It introduces support for Slack apps bots. See the
[Provider spec](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/v0.19.0/docs/spec/v1beta1/provider.md#slack-app)
for more information on how to get started.

reduce the amount of duplicate alerts sent by notification-controller.
The interval of the rate limit is set by default to `5m`
but can be configured with the `--rate-limit-interval` command arg.

The event server exposes HTTP request metrics to track the amount of rate limited events.
The following promql will get the rate at which requests are rate limited:
```
rate(gotk_event_http_request_duration_seconds_count{code="429"}[30s])
```

## 0.7.0

**Release date:** 2021-01-22

This is the seventh MINOR prerelease.

The `Receiver` API gains a new webhook type called `generic-hmac`,
that validates the caller legitimacy using HMAC signatures.

The `Alert` API comes with support for image update notifications
and is now possible to trigger container image updates to Git
using Sonatype Nexus webhooks.

Two new argument flags are introduced to support configuring the QPS
(`--kube-api-qps`) and burst (`--kube-api-burst`) while communicating
with the Kubernetes API server.

The `LocalObjectReference` from the Kubernetes core has been replaced
with our own, making `Name` a required field. The impact of this should
be limited to direct API consumers only, as the field was already
required by controller logic.
