# Providers

<!-- menuweight:40 -->

The `Provider` API defines how events are encoded and where to send them.

## Example

The following is an example of how to send alerts to Slack when Flux fails to
install or upgrade [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: slack-bot
  namespace: flagger-system
spec:
  type: slack
  channel: general
  address: https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage
  secretRef:
    name: slack-bot-token
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Alert
metadata:
  name: slack
  namespace: flagger-system
spec:
  summary: "Flagger impacted in us-east-2"
  providerRef:
    name: slack-bot
  eventSeverity: error
  eventSources:
    - kind: HelmRepository
      name: '*'
    - kind: HelmRelease
      name: '*'
```

In the above example:

- A Provider named `slack-bot` is created, indicated by the
  `Provider.metadata.name` field.
- An Alert named `slack` is created, indicated by the
  `Alert.metadata.name` field.
- The Alert references the `slack-bot` provider, indicated by the
  `Alert.spec.providerRef` field.
- The notification-controller starts listening for events sent for
  all HelmRepositories and HelmReleases in the `flagger-system` namespace.
- When an event with severity `error` is received, the controller posts
  a message on Slack containing the `summary` text and the Helm install or
  upgrade error.
- The controller uses the Slack Bot token from the secret indicated by the
  `Provider.spec.secretRef.name` to authenticate with the Slack API.

You can run this example by saving the manifests into `slack-alerts.yaml`.

1. First create a secret with the Slack bot token:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n flagger-system create secret generic slack-bot-token --from-literal=token=xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN
   ```

2. Apply the resources on the cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n flagger-system apply --server-side -f slack-alerts.yaml
   ```

3. Run `kubectl -n flagger-system describe provider slack-bot` to see its status:

   ```console
   ...
   Status:
     Conditions:
       Last Transition Time:  2022-11-16T23:43:38Z
       Message:               Initialized
       Observed Generation:   1
       Reason:                Succeeded
       Status:                True
       Type:                  Ready
     Observed Generation:     1
   Events:
     Type    Reason    Age   From                     Message
     ----    ------    ----  ----                     -------
     Normal  Succeeded 82s   notification-controller  Reconciliation finished, next run in 10m
   ```

## Writing a provider spec

As with all other Kubernetes config, a Provider needs `apiVersion`,
`kind`, and `metadata` fields. The name of an Alert object must be a
valid [DNS subdomain name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names).

A Provider also needs a
[`.spec` section](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status).

### Type

`.spec.type` is a required field that specifies which SaaS API to use.

The supported alerting providers are:

| Provider                                                | Type             |

#### Alerting

##### Generic webhook

When `.spec.type` is set to `generic`, the controller will send an HTTP POST
request to the provided [Address](#address).

The body of the request is a [JSON `Event` object](events.md#event-structure),
for example:

```json
{
  "involvedObject": {
    "apiVersion": "kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2",
    "kind": "Kustomization",
    "name": "webapp",
    "namespace": "apps",
    "uid": "7d0cdc51-ddcf-4743-b223-83ca5c699632"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/revision": "main/731f7eaddfb6af01cb2173e18f0f75b0ba780ef1"
  },
  "severity":"error",
  "reason": "ValidationFailed",
  "message":"service/apps/webapp validation error: spec.type: Unsupported value: Ingress",
  "reportingController":"kustomize-controller",
  "reportingInstance":"kustomize-controller-7c7b47f5f-8bhrp",
  "timestamp":"2022-10-28T07:26:19Z"
}
```

Where the `involvedObject` key contains the metadata from the object triggering
the event.

The controller includes a `Gotk-Component` header in the request, which can be
used to identify the component which sent the event, e.g. `source-controller`
or `notification-controller`.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 452
Content-Type: application/json
Gotk-Component: kustomize-controller
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1
```

You can add additional headers to the POST request using a [`headers` key in the
referenced Secret](#http-headers-example).

##### Generic webhook with HMAC

When `.spec.type` is set to `generic-hmac`, the controller will send an HTTP
POST request to the provided [Address](#address) for an [Event](events.md#event-structure),
while including an `X-Signature` HTTP header carrying the HMAC of the request
body. The inclusion of the header allows the receiver to verify the
authenticity and integrity of the request.

The `X-Signature` header is calculated by generating an HMAC of the request
body using the [`token` key from the referenced Secret](#token-example). The
HTTP header value has the following format:

```
X-Signature: <hash-function>=<hash>
```

`<hash-function>` denotes the hash function used to generate the HMAC and
currently defaults to `sha256`, which may change in the future. `<hash>` is the
HMAC of the request body, encoded as a hexadecimal string.

while `<hash>` is the hex-encoded HMAC value.

The body of the request is a [JSON `Event` object](events.md#event-structure),
as described in the [Generic webhook](#generic-webhook) section.

###### HMAC verification example

The following example in Go shows how to verify the authenticity and integrity
of a request by using the X-Signature header.

```go
func verifySignature(signature string, payload, key []byte) error {
	sig := strings.Split(signature, "=")

	if len(sig) != 2 {
		return fmt.Errorf("invalid signature value")
	}

	var newF func() hash.Hash
	switch sig[0] {
	case "sha224":
		newF = sha256.New224
	case "sha256":
		newF = sha256.New
	case "sha384":
		newF = sha512.New384
	case "sha512":
		newF = sha512.New
	default:
		return fmt.Errorf("unsupported signature algorithm %q", sig[0])
	}

	mac := hmac.New(newF, key)
	if _, err := mac.Write(payload); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to write payload to HMAC encoder: %w", err)
	}

	sum := fmt.Sprintf("%x", mac.Sum(nil))
	if sum != sig[1] {
		return fmt.Errorf("HMACs do not match: %#v != %#v", sum, sig[1])
	}
	return nil
}

func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Require a X-Signature header
	if len(r.Header["X-Signature"]) == 0 {
		http.Error(w, "missing X-Signature header", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// Read the request body with a limit of 1MB
	lr := io.LimitReader(r.Body, 1<<20)
	body, err := io.ReadAll(lr)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, "failed to read request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// Verify signature using the same token as the Secret referenced in
	// Provider
	key := "<token>"
	if err := verifySignature(r.Header.Get("X-Signature"), body, key); err != nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("failed to verify HMAC signature: %s", err.Error()), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// Do something with the verified request body
	// ...
}
```

##### Slack

When `.spec.type` is set to `slack`, the controller will send a message for an
[Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Slack API [Address](#address). 

The Event will be formatted into a Slack message using an [Attachment](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments),
with the metadata attached as fields, and the involved object as author.
The severity of the Event is used to set the color of the attachment.

When a [Channel](#channel) is provided, it will be added as a [`channel`
field](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#arg_channel) to the API
payload. Otherwise, the further configuration of the [Address](#address) will
determine the channel.

When [Username](#username) is set, this will be added as a [`username`
field](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#arg_username) to the
payload, defaulting to the name of the reporting controller.

This Provider type supports the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
and/or [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Slack example

To configure a Provider for Slack, we recommend using a Slack Bot App token which is
not attached to a specific Slack account. To obtain a token, please follow
[Slack's guide on creating an app](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#creating).

Once you have obtained a token, [create a Secret containing the `token`
key](#token-example) and a `slack` Provider with the `address` set to
`https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`.

Using this API endpoint, it is possible to send messages to multiple channels
by adding the integration to each channel.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: slack
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: slack
  channel: general
  address: https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage
  secretRef:
    name: slack-token
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: slack-token
  namespace: default
stringData:
    token: xoxb-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890
```

###### Slack (legacy) example

To configure a Provider for Slack using the [legacy incoming webhook API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks),
create a Secret with the `address` set to `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`,
and a `slack` Provider with a [Secret reference](#address-example).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: slack
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: slack
  secretRef:
    name: slack-webhook
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: slack-webhook
  namespace: default
stringData:
  address: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK"
```

##### Microsoft Teams

When `.spec.type` is set to `msteams`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Microsoft Teams [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a Microsoft Teams
[connector message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using#example-of-connector-message),
with the metadata attached as facts, and the involved object as summary.
The severity of the Event is used to set the color of the message.

This Provider type supports the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
and/or [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates), but lacks support for
configuring a [Channel](#channel). This can be configured during the
creation of the incoming webhook in Microsoft Teams.

###### Microsoft Teams example

To configure a Provider for Microsoft Teams, create a Secret with [the
`address`](#address-example) set to the [webhook URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook#create-incoming-webhooks-1),
and a `msteams` Provider with a [Secret reference](#address-example).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: msteams
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: msteams
  secretRef:
    name: msteams-webhook
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: msteams-webhook
  namespace: default
stringData:
    address: "https://xxx.webhook.office.com/..."
```

##### Discord

When `.spec.type` is set to `discord`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Discord [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a [Slack message](#slack) and send to the
`/slack` endpoint of the provided Discord [Address](#address).

This Provider type supports the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
and/or [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates), but lacks support for
configuring a [Channel](#channel). This can be configured [during the creation
of the address](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#create-webhook)

###### Discord example

To configure a Provider for Discord, create a Secret with [the `address`](#address-example)
set to the [webhook URL](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#create-webhook),
and a `discord` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: discord
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: discord
  secretRef:
    name: discord-webhook
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: discord-webhook
  namespace: default
stringData:
    address: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
```


##### Sentry

When `.spec.type` is set to `sentry`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Sentry [Address](#address).

Depending on the `severity` of the Event, the controller will capture a [Sentry
Event](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/)for `error`, or [Sentry
Transaction Event](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/transaction/)
with a [Span](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/span/) for `info`.
The metadata of the Event is included as [`extra` data](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/#optional-attributes)
in the Sentry Event, or as [Span `tags`](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/span/#attributes).

The Provider's [Channel](#channel) is used to set the `environment` on the
Sentry client.

This Provider type supports the configuration of
[TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Sentry example

To configure a Provider for Sentry, create a Secret with [the `address`](#address-example)
set to a [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/),
and a `sentry` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: sentry
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: sentry
  channel: staging-env
  secretRef:
    name: sentry-webhook
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: sentry-webhook
  namespace: default
stringData:
  address: "https://....@sentry.io/12341234"
```

**Note:** The `sentry` Provider also sends traces for events with the severity
`info`. This can be disabled by setting the `spec.eventSeverity` field to
`error` on an `Alert`.

##### Telegram

When `.spec.type` is set to `telegram`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Telegram [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a message string, with the metadata attached
as a list of key-value pairs.

The Provider's [Channel](#channel) is used to set the receiver of the message.
This can be a unique identifier (`-1234567890`) for the target chat, or
the username (`@username`) of the target channel.

This Provider type does not support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
or [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Telegram example

To configure a Provider for Telegram, create a Secret with [the `token`](#token-example)
obtained from [the BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot),
and a `telegram` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference), and the
`address` set to `https://api.telegram.org`.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: telegram
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: telegram
  address: https://api.telegram.org
  channel: "@fluxcd" # or "-1557265138" (channel id)
  secretRef:
    name: telegram-token
```

##### Matrix

When `.spec.type` is set to `matrix`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Matrix [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a message string, with the metadata attached 
as a list of key-value pairs, and send as a [`m.room.message` text event](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#mroommessage)
to the provided Matrix [Address](#address).

The Provider's [Channel](#channel) is used to set the receiver of the message
using a room identifier (`!1234567890:example.org`).

This provider type does support the configuration of [TLS
certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Matrix example

To configure a Provider for Matrix, create a Secret with [the `token`](#token-example)
obtained from [the Matrix endpoint](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server-api#registration),
and a `matrix` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: matrix
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: matrix
  address: https://matrix.org
  channel: "!jezptmDwEeLapMLjOc:matrix.org"
  secretRef:
    name: matrix-token
```

##### Lark

When `.spec.type` is set to `lark`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Lark [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a [Lark Message card](https://open.larksuite.com/document/ukTMukTMukTM/uczM3QjL3MzN04yNzcDN),
with the metadata written to the message string.

This Provider type does not support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
or [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Lark example

To configure a Provider for Lark, create a Secret with [the `address`](#address-example)
obtained from [adding a bot to a group](https://open.larksuite.com/document/uAjLw4CM/ukTMukTMukTM/bot-v3/use-custom-bots-in-a-group#57181e84),
and a `lark` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: lark
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: lark
  secretRef:
    name: lark-webhook
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: lark-webhook
  namespace: default
stringData:
    address: "https://open.larksuite.com/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

##### Rocket

When `.spec.type` is set to `rocket`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Rocket [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a [Slack message](#slack) and send as a
payload the provided Rocket [Address](#address).

This Provider type does support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
and [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Rocket example

To configure a Provider for Rocket, create a Secret with [the `address`](#address-example)
set to the Rocket [webhook URL](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/admin-panel/integrations#incoming-webhook-script),
and a `rocket` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: rocket
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: rocket
  secretRef:
    name: rocket-webhook
```

##### Google Chat

When `.spec.type` is set to `googlechat`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Google Chat [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a [Google Chat card message](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/cards-v1),
with the metadata added as a list of [key-value pairs](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/cards-v1#keyvalue)
in a [widget](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/cards-v1#widgetmarkup).

This Provider type does support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy).

###### Google Chat example

To configure a Provider for Google Chat, create a Secret with [the `address`](#address-example)
set to the Google Chat [webhook URL](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/webhooks#create_a_webhook),
and a `googlechat` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: google
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: googlechat
  secretRef:
    name: google-webhook
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: google-webhook
  namespace: default
stringData:
  address: https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/...
```

##### Google Pub/Sub

When `.spec.type` is set to `googlepubsub`, the controller will publish the payload of
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) on the Google Pub/Sub Topic ID provided in the
[Channel](#channel) field, which must exist in the GCP Project ID provided in the
[Address](#address) field of the secret referenced in the provider.

This Provider type can optionally use the [Secret reference](#secret-reference) to
authenticate on the Google Pub/Sub API by using [JSON credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-creds#key-types).
The credentials must be specified on [the `token`](#token-example) field of the Secret.

If no JSON credentials are specified, then the automatic authentication methods of
the Google libraries will take place, and therefore methods like Workload Identity
will be automatically attempted.

The Google identity effectively used for publishing messages must have
[the required permissions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#pubsub.publisher)
on the Pub/Sub Topic.

You can optionally add [attributes](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/samples/pubsub-publish-custom-attributes#pubsub_publish_custom_attributes-go)
to the Pub/Sub message using a [`headers` key in the referenced Secret](#http-headers-example).

This Provider type does not support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
or [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:

###### Google Pub/Sub with JSON Credentials and Custom Headers Example

To configure a Provider for Google Pub/Sub authenticating with JSON credentials and
custom headers, create a Secret with [the `token`](#token-example) set to the
necessary JSON credentials, [the `headers`](#http-headers-example) field set to a
YAML string-to-string dictionary, and a `googlepubsub` Provider with the associated
[Secret reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: googlepubsub-provider
  namespace: desired-namespace
spec:
  type: googlepubsub
  channel: <Pub/Sub Topic ID>

stringData:
  token: <GCP JSON credentials>
  address: <GCP Project ID>
  headers: |
    attr1-name: attr1-value
    attr2-name: attr2-value
```

##### Opsgenie

When `.spec.type` is set to `opsgenie`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Opsgenie [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a [Opsgenie alert](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/alert-api#section-create-alert-request),
with the metadata added to the [`details` field](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/alert-api#create-alert)
as a list of key-value pairs.

This Provider type does support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
and [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Opsgenie example

To configure a Provider for Opsgenie, create a Secret with [the `token`](#token-example)
set to the Opsgenie [API token](https://support.atlassian.com/opsgenie/docs/create-a-default-api-integration/),
and a `opsgenie` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference) and the
`address` set to `https://api.opsgenie.com/v2/alerts`.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: opsgenie
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: opsgenie
  address: https://api.opsgenie.com/v2/alerts
  secretRef:
    name: opsgenie-token
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: opsgenie-token
  namespace: default
stringData:
    token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

##### Prometheus Alertmanager

When `.spec.type` is set to `alertmanager`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Prometheus Alertmanager
[Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a `firing` [Prometheus Alertmanager
alert](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/notifications/#alert),
with the metadata added to the `labels` fields, and the `message` (and optional
`.metadata.summary`) added as annotations.

In addition to the metadata from the Event, the following labels will be added:

| Label     | Description                                                                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| alertname | The string Flux followed by the Kind and the reason for the event e.g `FluxKustomizationProgressing` |
| severity  | The severity of the event (`error` or `info`)                                                        |
| timestamp | The timestamp of the event                                                                           |
| reason    | The machine readable reason for the objects transition into the current status                       |
| kind      | The kind of the involved object associated with the event                                            |
| name      | The name of the involved object associated with the event                                            |
| namespace | The namespace of the involved object associated with the event                                       |

This Provider type does support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
and [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Prometheus Alertmanager example

To configure a Provider for Prometheus Alertmanager, create a Secret with [the
`address`](#address-example) set to the Prometheus Alertmanager [HTTP API
URL](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/https/#http-traffic)
including Basic Auth credentials, and a `alertmanager` Provider with a [Secret
reference](#secret-reference).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: alertmanager
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: alertmanager
  secretRef:
    name: alertmanager-address
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: alertmanager-address
  namespace: default
stringData:
    address: https://username:password@<alertmanager-url>/api/v2/alerts/"
```

##### Webex

When `.spec.type` is set to `webex`, the controller will send a payload for
an [Event](events.md#event-structure) to the provided Webex [Address](#address).

The Event will be formatted into a message string, with the metadata attached
as a list of key-value pairs, and send as a [Webex message](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/messages/create-a-message).

The [Channel](#channel) is used to set the ID of the room to send the message
to.

This Provider type does support the configuration of a [proxy URL](#https-proxy)
and [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates).

###### Webex example

To configure a Provider for Webex, create a Secret with [the `token`](#token-example)
set to the Webex [access token](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started#authentication),
and a `webex` Provider with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference) and the
`address` set to `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages`.

**Note:** To be able to send messages to a Webex room, the bot needs to be
added to the room. Failing to do so will result in 404 errors, logged by the
controller.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: webex
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: webex
  address: https://webexapis.com/v1/messages
  channel: <webexSpaceRoomID>
  secretRef:
    name: webex-token
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: webex-token
  namespace: default
stringData:
  token: <bot-token>
```

### Address

`.spec.address` is an optional field that specifies the URL where the events are posted.

If the address contains sensitive information such as tokens or passwords, it is 
recommended to store the address in the Kubernetes secret referenced by `.spec.secretRef.name`.
When the referenced Secret contains an `address` key, the `.spec.address` value is ignored.

### Channel

`.spec.channel` is an optional field that specifies the channel where the events are posted.

### Username

`.spec.username` is an optional field that specifies the username used to post
the events. Can be overwritten with a [Secret reference](#secret-reference).

### Secret reference

`.spec.secretRef.name` is an optional field to specify a name reference to a
Secret in the same namespace as the Provider, containing the authentication
credentials for the provider API.

The Kubernetes secret can have any of the following keys:

- `address` - overrides `.spec.address`
- `proxy` - overrides `.spec.proxy`
- `token` - used for authentication
- `username` - overrides `.spec.username`
- `headers` - HTTP headers values included in the POST request

#### Address example

For providers which embed tokens or other sensitive information in the URL,
the incoming webhooks address can be stored in the secret using the `address` key:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-provider-url
  namespace: default
stringData:
  address: "https://webhook.example.com/token"
```

#### Token example

For providers which require token based authentication, the API token
can be stored in the secret using the `token` key:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-provider-auth
  namespace: default
stringData:
  token: "my-api-token"
```

#### HTTP headers example

For providers which require specific HTTP headers to be attached to the POST request,
the headers can be set in the secret using the `headers` key:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-provider-headers
  namespace: default
stringData:
  headers: |
    Authorization: my-api-token
    X-Forwarded-Proto: https
```

#### Proxy auth example

Some networks need to use an authenticated proxy to access external services.
Therefore, the proxy address can be stored as a secret to hide parameters like the username and password:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-provider-proxy
  namespace: default
stringData:
  proxy: "http://username:password@proxy_url:proxy_port"
```

### TLS certificates

`.spec.certSecretRef` is an optional field to specify a name reference to a
Secret in the same namespace as the Provider, containing the TLS CA certificate.

#### Example

To enable notification-controller to communicate with a provider API over HTTPS
using a self-signed TLS certificate, set the `caFile` like so:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: my-webhook
  namespace: flagger-system
spec:
  type: generic
  address: https://my-webhook.internal
  certSecretRef:
    name: my-ca-crt
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-ca-crt
  namespace: default
stringData:
  caFile: |
    <--- CA Key --->
```

### HTTP/S proxy

`.spec.proxy` is an optional field to specify an HTTP/S proxy address.

If the proxy address contains sensitive information such as basic auth credentials, it is
recommended to store the proxy in the Kubernetes secret referenced by `.spec.secretRef.name`.
When the referenced Secret contains a `proxy` key, the `.spec.proxy` value is ignored.

### Interval

`.spec.interval` is a required field with a default of ten minutes that specifies
the time interval at which the controller reconciles the provider with its Secret
references.

### Suspend

`.spec.suspend` is an optional field to suspend the provider.
When set to `true`, the controller will stop sending events to this provider.
When the field is set to `false` or removed, it will resume.

## Working with Providers


### Grafana

To send notifications to [Grafana annotations API](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/http_api/annotations/),
enable the annotations on a Dashboard like so:

- Annotations > Query > Enable Match any
- Annotations > Query > Tags (Add Tag: `flux`)

If Grafana has authentication configured, create a Kubernetes Secret with the API token:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic grafana-token \
--from-literal=token=<grafana-api-key> \
```

Grafana can also use basic authorization to authenticate the requests, if both the token and
the username/password are set in the secret, then token takes precedence over`basic auth:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic grafana-token \
--from-literal=username=<your-grafana-username> \
--from-literal=password=<your-grafana-password>
```

Create a provider of type `grafana` and reference the `grafana-token` secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: grafana
  address: https://<grafana-url>/api/annotations
  secretRef:
    name: grafana-token
```

### GitHub dispatch

The `githubdispatch` provider generates GitHub events of type
[`repository_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event)
for the selected repository. The `repository_dispatch` events can be used to trigger GitHub Actions workflow.

The request includes the `event_type` and `client_payload` fields:

- `event_type` is generated from the involved object in the format `{Kind}/{Name}.{Namespace}`.
- `client_payload` contains the [Flux event](events.md).

### Setting up the GitHub dispatch provider

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: github-dispatch
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  type: githubdispatch
  address: https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo
  secretRef:
    name: api-token
```

The `address` is the address of your repository where you want to send webhooks to trigger GitHub workflows.

GitHub uses personal access tokens for authentication with its API:

* [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

The provider requires a secret in the same format, with the personal access token as the value for the token key:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: api-token
  namespace: default
data:
  token: <personal-access-tokens>
```

#### Setting up a GitHub workflow

To trigger a GitHub Actions workflow when a Flux Kustomization finishes reconciling,
you need to set the event type for the repository_dispatch trigger to match the Flux object ID:

```yaml
name: test-github-dispatch-provider
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [Kustomization/podinfo.flux-system]
```

Assuming that we deploy all Flux kustomization resources in the same namespace,
it will be useful to have a unique kustomization resource name for each application.
This will allow you to use only `event_type` to trigger tests for the exact application.

Let's say we have following folder structure for applications kustomization manifests:

```bash
apps/
├── app1
│   └── overlays
│       ├── production
│       └── staging
└── app2
    └── overlays
        ├── production
        └── staging
```

You can then create a flux kustomization resource for the app to have unique `event_type` per app.
The kustomization manifest for app1/staging:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: app1
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  path: "./app1/staging"
```

You would also like to know from the notification which cluster is being used for deployment.
You can add the `spec.summary` field to the Flux alert configuration to mention the relevant cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Alert
metadata:
  name: github-dispatch
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  summary: "staging (us-west-2)"
  providerRef:
    name: github-dispatch
  eventSeverity: info
  eventSources:
    - kind: Kustomization
      name: 'podinfo'
```

Now you can the trigger tests in the GitHub workflow for app1 in a staging cluster when
the app1 resources defined in `./app1/staging/` are reconciled by Flux:

```yaml
name: test-github-dispatch-provider
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [Kustomization/podinfo.flux-system]
jobs:
  run-tests-staging:
    if: github.event.client_payload.metadata.summary == 'staging (us-west-2)'
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
    - name: Run tests
      run: echo "running tests.."
```

### Azure Event Hub

The Azure Event Hub supports two authentication methods, [JWT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/authenticate-application)
and [SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/authorize-access-shared-access-signature) based.

#### JWT based auth

In JWT we use 3 input values. Channel, token and address.
We perform the following translation to match we the data we need to communicate with Azure Event Hub.

- channel = Azure Event Hub namespace
- address = Azure Event Hub name 
- token   = JWT

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: azure
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: azureeventhub
  address: <event-hub-name>
  channel: <event-hub-namespace>
  secretRef:
    name: azure-token
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: azure-token
  namespace: default
stringData:
  token: <event-hub-token>
```

The controller doesn't take any responsibility for the JWT token to be updated.
You need to use a secondary tool to make sure that the token in the secret is renewed.

If you want to make a easy test assuming that you have setup a Azure Enterprise application and you called it
event-hub you can follow most of the bellow commands. You will need to provide the `client_secret` that you got
when generating the Azure Enterprise Application.

```shell
export AZURE_CLIENT=$(az ad app list --filter "startswith(displayName,'event-hub')" --query '[].appId' |jq -r '.[0]')
export AZURE_SECRET='secret-client-secret-generated-at-creation'
export AZURE_TENANT=$(az account show -o tsv --query tenantId)

curl -X GET --data 'grant_type=client_credentials' --data "client_id=$AZURE_CLIENT" --data "client_secret=$AZURE_SECRET" --data 'resource=https://eventhubs.azure.net' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' https://login.microsoftonline.com/$AZURE_TENANT/oauth2/token |jq .access_token
```

Use the output you got from `curl` and add it to your secret like bellow:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic azure-token \
--from-literal=token='A-valid-JWT-token'
```

#### SAS based auth

When using SAS auth, we only use the `address` field in the secret.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: azure
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: azureeventhub
  secretRef:
    name: azure-webhook
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: azure-webhook
  namespace: default
stringData:
  address: <SAS-URL>
```

Assuming that you have created the Azure event hub and namespace you should be
able to use a similar command to get your connection string. This will give
you the default Root SAS, which is NOT supposed to be used in production.

```shell
az eventhubs namespace authorization-rule keys list --resource-group <rg-name> --namespace-name <namespace-name> --name RootManageSharedAccessKey -o tsv --query primaryConnectionString
# The output should look something like this:
Endpoint=sb://fluxv2.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=yoursaskeygeneatedbyazure
```

To create the needed secret:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic azure-webhook \
--from-literal=address="Endpoint=sb://fluxv2.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=yoursaskeygeneatedbyazure"
```

### Git Commit Status Updates

The notification-controller can mark Git commits as reconciled by posting
Flux `Kustomization` events to the origin repository using Git SaaS providers APIs.

#### Example

The following is an example of how to update the Git commit status for the GitHub repository where
Flux was bootstrapped with `flux bootstrap github --owner=my-gh-org --repository=my-gh-repo`.

```yaml
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: github-status
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  type: github
  address: https://github.com/my-gh-org/my-gh-repo
  secretRef:
    name: github-token
---
apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Alert
metadata:
  name: github-status
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  providerRef:
    name: github-status
  eventSources:
    - kind: Kustomization
      name: flux-system
```

#### GitHub

When `.spec.type` is set to `github`, the referenced secret must contain a key called `token` with the value set to a
[GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

The token must have permissions to update the commit status for the GitHub repository specified in `.spec.address`.

You can create the secret with `kubectl` like this:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic github-token --from-literal=token=<GITHUB-TOKEN>
```

#### GitLab

When `.spec.type` is set to `gitlab`, the referenced secret must contain a key called `token` with the value set to a
[GitLab personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

The token must have permissions to update the commit status for the GitLab repository specified in `.spec.address`.

You can create the secret with `kubectl` like this:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic gitlab-token --from-literal=token=<GITLAB-TOKEN>
```

#### Gitea

When `.spec.type` is set to `gitea`, the referenced secret must contain a key called `token` with the value set to a
[Gitea token](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/api-usage/#generating-and-listing-api-tokens).

The token owner must have permissions to update the commit status for the Gitea repository specified in `.spec.address`.

You can create the secret with `kubectl` like this:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic gitea-token --from-literal=token=<GITEA-TOKEN>
```

#### BitBucket

When `.spec.type` is set to `bitbucket`, the referenced secret must contain a key called `token` with the value
set to a BitBucket username and an
[app password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/#Create-an-app-password)
in the format `<username>:<app-password>`.

The app password must have `Repositories (Read/Write)` permission for
the BitBucket repository specified in `.spec.address`.

You can create the secret with `kubectl` like this:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic bitbucket-token --from-literal=token=<username>:<app-password>
```

#### Azure DevOps

When `.spec.type` is set to `azuredevops`, the referenced secret must contain a key called `token` with the value set to a
[Azure DevOps personal access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).

The token must have permissions to update the commit status for the Azure DevOps repository specified in `.spec.address`.

You can create the secret with `kubectl` like this:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic azuredevops-token --from-literal=token=<AZURE-TOKEN>
```

## Provider Status

### Conditions

An Provider enters various states during its lifecycle, reflected as
[Kubernetes Conditions][typical-status-properties].
It can be [ready](#ready-provider), [stalled](#stalled-provider), or it can [fail during
reconciliation](#failed-provider).

The Provider API is compatible with the [kstatus specification][kstatus-spec],
and reports `Reconciling` and `Stalled` conditions where applicable to
provide better (timeout) support to solutions polling the Provider to become
`Ready`.

#### Ready Provider

The notification-controller marks a Provider as _ready_ when it has the following
characteristics:

- The Provider's address and proxy are well-formatted URLs.
- The Provider's referenced Secrets are found on the cluster.
- The Provider's referenced Secrets contain valid keys and values.

When the Provider is "ready", the controller sets a Condition with the following
attributes in the Provider's `.status.conditions`:

- `type: Ready`
- `status: "True"`
- `reason: Succeeded`

#### Stalled Provider

The notification-controller may not be able to reconcile a Provider due to miss-configuration.
This can occur due to some of the following factors:

- The specified address and/or proxy is not a valid URL.
- The specified proxy is not a valid URL.

When this happens, the controller sets the `Ready` Condition status to `False`,
and adds a Condition with the following attributes:

- `type: Stalling`
- `status: "True"`
- `reason: InvalidURL`

This condition has a ["negative polarity"][typical-status-properties],
and is only present on the Provider while the status value is `"True"`.

#### Failed Provider

The notification-controller may get stuck trying to reconcile a Provider.
This can occur due to some of the following factors:

- The [Secret reference](#secret-reference) contains a reference to a
  non-existing Secret.
- The credentials in the referenced Secret are invalid.
- The [TLS Secret reference](#tls-certificates) contains a reference to a
  non-existing Secret.
- The TLS certs in the referenced Secret are invalid.

When this happens, the controller sets the `Ready` Condition status to `False`,
and adds a Condition with the following attributes:

- `type: Reconciling`
- `status: "True"`
- `reason: ProgressingWithRetry`

While the Provider has this Condition, the controller will continue to attempt
to reconcile it with an exponential backoff, until
it succeeds and the Provider is marked as [ready](#ready-provider).

### Observed Generation

The notification-controller reports an
[observed generation][typical-status-properties]
in the Provider's `.status.observedGeneration`. The observed generation is the
latest `.metadata.generation` which resulted in a [ready state](#ready-provider).

### Last Handled Reconcile At

The notification-controller reports the last `reconcile.fluxcd.io/requestedAt`
annotation value it acted on in the `.status.lastHandledReconcileAt` field.
